"Embroiled in a scandal over his past wearing of blackface and brownface, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau now faces international criticism after new childhood pictures of his brother and him riding on the back of black children during a trip to Kenya.","The Canadian leader who’s actually running for reelection was embarrassed by two pictures and one video showing him wearing racist makeup during the first week of the election campaign. This new picture taken in 1981 by a Kenyan diplomat has stirred outrage around the world, bringing reactions from several Canadian politicians as well as foreign leaders. The leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer, said the recent series of revelations about Justin Trudeau’s past tend to show a “darker and creepier side hidden behind his good-guy image”. Even U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the pictures and the scandal during a press conference this morning. A photo of Justin Trudeau at West Point Grey Academy’s Arabian Nights gala in April 2001 was the first of a series of picture suggesting Trudeau in racially sensible positions revealed over only a few days. Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada since 2015 and he has built his political career around his image of a modern open-minded politician. This series of pictures and videos which seems to become longer and more shocking every day has already affected his party, which was largely favorite for the upcoming election. The latest polls suggest his Liberal Party of Canada could now finish second, as its image of the left-wing multiculturally-oriented party was hit hard by its leader’s racist past.

A man who had his own brain replaced by a woman’s brain in September during a groundbreaking medical procedure had five car accidents in less than two weeks since he was released from the hospital.,"53-year old Phil Robertson from Scranton in Pennsylvania was miraculously saved from a brain cancer a few months ago by undergoing a successful brain transplant. He received the brain of a 37-year old woman who had died in a car accident and the operation had unforeseen consequences for the poor man. After several weeks of re-education, he was finally released from the hospital two weeks ago and returned to work. But the truck driver who had never had an accident in his life says he literally forgot how to drive. Mr. Robertson says the surgery has also totally changed his personality and his outlook on life. Dr. James Ford who performed the transplant says that minor changes in the patient’s skills or personality are normal after such a major surgery, but should gradually resorb over time. According to the doctor who treated Mr. Robertson, he should regain his lost abilities and his old personality over the next few months, but they admit that there is a small risk that some of these changes could be permanent. Dr. Ford says there is approximately a 5% chance that Mr. Robertson will be unable to “overwrite” the brain’s former knowledge, but that he normally should be able to adapt and recover over time. He estimates that this adaptation process could take between six and 18 months before he is totally back to his former self. excellent Jesus fuck, that’s enough internet for one day.

A man from Moultonborough in New Hampshire had to be transported to the hospital this afternoon after his pet squirrel got stuck in his anal cavity.,"60-year Ray Frankfurt called 911 himself around 3 pm after he found himself in a pretty uncomfortable position. Janice Monroe, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. Despite Ms. Monroe’s doubts, she sent an ambulance to the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Frank Meyers, one of the paramedics who transported Mr. Frankfurt, claims the poor man was lying naked in his bathroom and a hairy red tail was protruding from his anus. Ray Frankfurt was transported to the Huggings Hospital in Wolfeboro, where doctors were able to extract the rodent. The retired mailman suffered from severe internal bleeding but was finally stabilized after a two-hour surgery. The squirrel, unfortunately, didn’t survive his misadventure. This picture of Mr. Frankfurt with his beloved Slimy was taken less than a week before the incident. Mr. Frankfurt’s problem might seem fairly unusual, but similar incidents occur a lot more frequently than most people would think. Every year, an average of 5739 Americans are hospitalized after getting foreign objects stuck in their anal cavity. Among these “foreign objects”, an average of 19 are animals, including mostly fishes, snakes and small rodents like mice or rats. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Frankfurt is the first American to get a squirrel stuck in his rear end since 2007. He has refused to comment the incident and declined all demands for an interview. Another crazy white sick sub-human with perverted sexual affliction. The White culture people are desperate to protect and uphold. Another crazy black racist with ridiculous ideas. Trying to bury his nuts ?? Animal raped him , but there is no witnesses to confirm that , torn ass is a sign of rape which this poor man had . Next time mr.

 ,"Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Pickett’s father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the Confederate war general was a woman. The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as American historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document. The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was, in fact, Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister. It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was, in fact, the real ‘man’ behind the legend. Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16. The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him. “It was not uncommon at the time to fake documents or steal someone’s identity. What is truly interesting in this case, is that the former Colonel decided to send his daughter at the United States Military Academy in the place of his son and that she eventually showed to possess extraordinary military leadership” claims the Austin based historian. Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Pickett’s senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates a hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth. “This particular condition played a great part in hiding her true identity to others throughout her adult life” admits John Adams White, an American Civil War historian and expert, who was the first to point out discrepancies in George Pickett’s biography. “The discovery of the will of Colonel Robert Pickett finally explains important anachronistic elements of the man’s life” he concedes. Rio Barnhart look at the facial features. She was a woman. Men don’t have that feminine look to that degree. You can call it propaganda all you want but there are times the male takes the woman’s name not always does a woman have to take a mans name. Your email address will not be published.

"The oldest Canadian woman alive was celebrating her 124th anniversary this morning in Mississauga, and she gave a surprising answer when asked the secret of her incredible longevity: she drinks a cup of semen every day.","Eleanor Clarice Gladstone was born in 1895 in Hamilton, in Ontario. She was married and widowed twice, had seven children, 28 grandchildren and dozens of great-grandchildren. More than 250 people gathered yesterday to celebrate her birthday, including her family as well as several media representatives. When asked by reporters if she had any secrets to remain healthy and alert at her age, the elderly woman gave an answer that provoked uncontrollable laughter from the guests. Ms. Gladstone says she had to hide her health secret when she was younger because of society’s social conservatism at the beginning of the 20th century and says she hopes others can now benefit from her discovery. Ms. Gladstone says she has been collecting sperm from residents at her senior’s residence since the death of her husband to be able to get her daily cup. Experts consulted on the subject confirmed that semen has several beneficial effects that help overall longevity. Notably, due to the endorphins, estrone, prolactin, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and serotonin contained in it, semen has incredible natural antidepressant properties. It also has several benefits including stress-relieving and anxiety-reducing properties as well as sleep regulate hormones, but one specific element in semen could explain Ms. Gladstone’s incredible longevity: Spermidine. When ingested, this unique element has been proven to dramatically increase the lifespan of animals by as much as 25 percent and was also found to prevent liver disease as well as liver cancer.   That’s a whole lot of man gravy granny!

An elderly man from Salta in Argentina claims that he’s the infamous German dictator Adolf Hitler and that he spent the last 70 years in hiding.,"In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper  , the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg. He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that he’s actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. He says he’s decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year. The elderly man claims he’s preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image. He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September. Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isn’t really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia. Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimer’s disease. She believes her husband may possibly have been a Nazi and that he may feel guilty about his past, but she’s convinced he’s not Hitler. Mr. Gunterberg’s wife claims he’s not Adolf Hitler, only a senile old man who is beginning to lose his mind. Even if the elderly man’s claim seem rather questionable, they have sparked an animated debate in Israel and in the American Jewish community concerning the future of surviving Nazi war criminals. Mossad had proved its ambition and global reach in the past with the capture of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1960 in Argentina, but it has abandoned this mission over recent years. The Wiesenthal Center, which is still trying to find and prosecute Nazi criminals, has publicly criticized Israel in March, saying the Jewish state was ‘barely cooperating’ to its mission. More than 70 years after the end of World War 2, few states and institutions are still trying to find and prosecute the surviving Nazis and most of them will certainly die without ever being punished for their crimes.

Lexington | A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ.,"According to the  Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ.  wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.   whatever makes you happy man…

A New Mexico man has been arrested and accused of kidnapping local neighborhood dogs and making wigs and various accessories with their fur.,"Los Lunas authorities became increasingly alarmed after dozens of pets had disappeared in the area in the past year. A local citizen also alerted the Los Lunas Police Department after discovering that Jeremiah Bishop, 79, was operating a website where he managed to sell wigs, fur handbags, and custom underwear. Bishop had already attracted attention in the area for his eccentric hairstyles, wearing different wigs every day with highly unconventional color patterns. Local neighbor Isabella Juarez says she was devastated after losing three of her dogs in the past year and learning that Bishop probably made various accessories out of their fur. Los Lunas police seized no less than 16 dog pelts but found countless accessories allegedly made from his victims’ fur. 19 wigs treated with bleach and different color dyes were also found on the location. 56 items of clothing manufactured from the fur of the dead animals were also seized by police such as pairs of socks, bras and men’s underwear. Packaged dog meat was also found in large quantities in the man’s freezer, leading officials to believe Bishop might also have eaten the meat and organs of his victims. It is not presently known how many dogs were kidnapped and slaughtered by Bishop, but local authorities estimate between 60 and 200 dogs may have fallen prey to the retired hairdresser. If found guilty and according to current animal cruelty laws in the state of New Mexico, Jeremiah Bishop, 79, could face up to three days in jail and a $500 fine.

"Garden City, UT| The remains of a large unidentified creature resembling a dinosaur, were found this morning on the western shore of Bear Lake, giving rise to many rumors concerning the legendary monster associated with the site.","The decomposed remains were found by a couple of locals who were walking on the lake’s shore. James and Christina Wilson noticed a foul smell while they were still hundreds of yards away and decided to investigate, leading to the discovery 25-foot (8 m) long carcass. The remains of the creature were partially emptied by the elements and scavengers, but still weigh more than two tons, suggesting the creature must have been enormous. A group of experts from the Utah Division of Wildlife Ressources, directed by Dr. Brian Upton, was rapidly dispatched on the site to inspect the creature. They told reporters the remains look somewhat similar to a crocodile or a mosasaur, an extinct group of large marine reptiles, but more tests and analysis are necessary to determine the true nature of the creature. Dr. Upton says the remains are very similar to a type of Aigialosaurus, a subtype of the mesosaur family of marine reptiles that lived during the Cretaceous period. The discovery of this gigantic creature in Bear Lake could finally bring an explanation to almost 150 years of alleged attacks and sightings in the region. The myth of the “Bear Lake Monster” originally grew from articles written in the 19th century by Joseph C. Rich, a Mormon colonizer in the area, purporting to report second-hand accounts of sightings of the creature. In an 1868 article in the Deseret News, he announced that   before going on to relate several sightings of the creature in recent times. The article created a stir in Salt Lake City and within a month  A 1907 letter published in a Logan, Utah newspaper claimed that two men had seen the Bear Lake behemoth attack their camp and kill one of their horses. A 4-year-old also claimed to have seen it in 1937, and a boy scout leader spoke of seeing it in 1946. In recent years the monster was mostly considered to be a tourist attraction, and the last reported sighting of the monster was in June 2002, when Bear Lake business owner, Brian Hirsch, claims to have seen the monster.

"Pahala, HI | A scuba diver is being hospitalized at Ka’u hospital on the island of Hawaii after he inserted his penis into a giant clam while recreational diving.","Sean Madison, 22, was transported to Ka’u hospital after suffering from severe breathing complications, vomiting, extreme swelling and low blood pressure. Doctors believe physical contact with the giant mollusk may have triggered his allergy to seafood and exposed him to high levels of arsenic. Madison, 22, whose condition has stabilized, said he inserted his penis inside the clam as a prank to impress his friend, Thomas Meyer. The amateur diver also admitted he was still hung over from the night before and had consumed GHB and ecstasy, which impaired his judgment at the time. After eventually releasing himself from the clam, the young man later developed a severe allergic reaction and was rushed to Ka’u Hospital. Dr. Andrew Smith at Ka’u Hospital believes Madison’s body reacted to the digestive enzymes of the giant mollusk, which was possibly trying to digest the man’s genitals at the time of the incident. Dr. Smith admits it is the first case of its kind he has seen in his 22 years of practice. A fatal incident occurred at the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu in 2014 when an aquarium employee put his head inside a giant clam and lost consciousness before he could be rescued, confirming the local reputation of the mollusk as a ‘killer clam’.

"Washington, D.C. | A man from Virginia turned himself in at the FBI headquarters this morning, claiming that he was guilty of killing more than 30 people, including the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.","71-year-old Leroy Timothy Anderson, claims he worked for 35 years as a “time-traveling assassin” for a secret governmental agency and says he has killed people at various times, going from 1678 to 2239. The elderly man declared that his actions were all legitimate and ordered by the government, but that he fears his former employers might want to eliminate him because he knows too much. He claims that he was part a program called the Chronos Project, which was designed, coordinated, and executed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States special operations forces, under the supervision of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This ultra-secret program would have orchestrated more than 1200 assassinations, spreading out over almost all of human history, including many famous characters like Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Cesar or Mahatma Gandhi. “His story was clearly one of the most entertaining that I have ever heard,” said FBI director, Christopher A. Wray. “I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincoln’s murder and stuff like that, but the FBI isn’t going to open an investigation. I don’t think this man killed anyone, I think he just lost contact with reality.” According to the FBI, Mr. Anderson was previously diagnosed with dissociative disorder and schizophrenia, problems which could explain his strange confession. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending the play   at Ford’s Theatre, in Washington, D.C.  as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination is generally believed to have been planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause. Mr. Booth was shot and killed by Union soldiers while hiding on a farm in Virginia, only days after the crime. Eight other conspirators or suspects were tried and convicted, and four were hanged shortly thereafter. They need to investigate!!!

"San Mateo, CA | A Californian man is being treated at the San Mateo Medical Center after his boyfriend’s fist was stuck for a painstaking 14 hours in his own rectum.","The couple who were allegedly practicing “fisting,” a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the partner’s rectum, called 9-1-1 after they were unable to release the man’s hand from his boyfriend’s anal cavity. Both men were transported by ambulance to San Mateo Medical Center where hospital staff successfully released the man’s hand only 14 hours later, a complicated task due to heavy inflammation, blood loss and risk of laceration, say doctors. “I just talked to my mom on the phone and she told me she had felt the same thing when she was in labor,” he admitted. “My mom was really supportive through this whole ordeal. She talked to me on the phone the whole time the doctors were trying to get Hernando’s hand out of there. She’s just the greatest,” he added in tears. Mathew Cunning’s boyfriend, Hernando Iglesias, says his big hands and the fact they did not use any lubricant are to blame for the incident. The couple firmly believes that, had they used lubricant, the trip to the hospital could have been avoided. “I usually use Crisco or vegetable oil but we were out of everything. It was definitely not our lucky day” admits Iglesias, visibly amused by the media attention. “Matt is a real hero, he handled the pain like a real soldier. The hospital staff was awesome. They found me a bed so I could sleep a few hours through the procedure,” he added. Matthew Cunning, who has lost a large amount of blood and received an impressive 37 stitches, is set to be released from the hospital in the next few days and should not endure any permanent damage from the incident, say doctors. Although Cunning admits his “handballing” days aren’t necessarily over, he hopes others in the “fisting community” will pay heed to this incident and use the proper lubricants to safely enjoy the practice.

"A 117-year old man from Texas was liberated from prison this morning after outliving a 99-year sentence, becoming the first prisoner to do so in the history of the United States.","Grandson of one the most famous horse thief in American history, Henry William Borne was arrested by the Texas Rangers in 1919 for being part of in an important horse-stealing ring. His father, Henry Borne Jr., was hanged in Fort Worth alongside one of their accomplices, Mark Thompson, on March 16, 1920. Borne, his father and seven other accomplices were accused of stealing over 7,000 horses and mules, including a lot of 1,735 horses destined to the American military effort in the first World War. The eight others were sentenced to death and hanged in 1920, while Borne, who was underage when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to 99 years in prison. Unexpectedly, the Amarillo native actually survived his sentence, which was spent in a total of 11 different detention centers. He was liberated this morning from the Central Unit Prison, in Sugar Land, after spending almost an entire century behind bars. Visibly emotional, Mr. Borne expressed his worries about adapting to life in the 21st Century. Despite his long incarceration, the 117-year old man also fears he could have difficulty adapting to a life without crime. Despite his fears, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice considers there is a “very low risk” that he will resume his life of crime. In fact, the number of horse theft has constantly dropped over the last century and the use of identification microchips over recent years has made such crimes much easier to solve. Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2011 theft of five horses. Another reason as to why the US is scum of this earth.. biggest shame I’ve heard to, lately. I think he should have been released long ago!! He looks amazing!! How in the hell can they even entertain the thought he would return to a life of stealing horses away 117 years old. Nonetheless, im happy he made it and is now free to enjoy a year or so if life left. 117!! What the heck did they feed this man , organic vegetables!!! Poor guy he should have been released. WE just picked my father up from California Department of Corrections where he went in at 22 for robbery, no injuries. He is 69 now. No money, no clothes, he has me his only child and my kids and grandkids. There are thousands of people buried in there, forgotten and doing life for petty crimes due to 3 strikes law. What happened to no “Cruel and Unusual Punishment”. People are getting rich in the “prison” business in this country. Shame on California and the governors of all these states for back room deals and political gains with prison contracts. Deplorable! Your email address will not be published.

"Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.","The crew of the   (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil. The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears. The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling. “It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds. Some Greenpeace supporters have even celebrated the incident as a victory for the fight against whale hunting worldwide Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986. I’m surprised at the lack of press on this. They might be assigned some sort of public service to animal rights activists so they can atone for their atrocities.

A lottery winner from Minnesota found a very unusual use of his freshly won fortune: he purchased the restaurant where he had worked for 17 years… only to force his former boss to wear a ridiculous chicken costume!,"49-year old Paul Watson from Rochester won an astonishing $149 million in March from the Multi-Millions Minnesota State Lottery. When asked by organizers what he would do with the money, he had simply answered: “Get rid of my stinking job, maybe get back at my stupid ass boss”. Mr. Watson held true to his word, purchasing the restaurant where he used to work and giving raises to every employee except one… restaurant manager Oscar Reyes. He had something special planned for his former boss. Paul Watson made Mr. Reyes the restaurant’s “public relations director”, a job consisting of distributing fried chicken samples on the street dressed in a chicken costume. While the new owner seems to find this “promotion” amusing, Oscar Reyes says his new job is extremely demeaning and exposes him to constant harassment. He is filing a $185,000 lawsuit against Mr. Watson and Chikorama. Mr. Reyes says his new boss not only forces him to wear a ridiculous mascot costume but as even put up signs encouraging customers to “force-feed the chicken”, leading to several unpleasant incidents. Mr. Watson told reporters he doesn’t care about the lawsuit, claiming that “getting even with that man is priceless”. He also said he was planning on getting back at his two ex-wives and “might have to make some more investments in order to sake revenge against them”. The Rochester Police Department confirmed that it had dispatched officers to have a discussion with Mr. Watson concerning his threats and that it would be watching him closely.

"Washington, D.C. | The Supreme Court of the United States has granted to the Georgian slave descendant, Abraham Brown, “40 acres of land and a mule”, in a historic decision that could affect thousands of African Americans.","The 61-year old man filed a lawsuit against the federal government in 2011, accusing the United States of violating their obligations to his ancestor, who died in 1891. His great-grandfather, Elijah Brown, along with 18,000 other freed slaves who had fought for the Union in the American Civil War, had been promised “40 acres of land and a mule” by the U.S. army in 1865, but never received anything. By a narrow 5-4 vote, the Supreme court ruled that the U.S. government had to hold the promises made to these 18,000 freed slaves, by granting the promised acreage and animals to their descendants. Mr. Brown and his supporters were visibly happy when the court announced the verdict, applauding and cheering loudly as the court announced its decision. The Supreme court decision is based on military orders issued during the American Civil War. The orders dealing specifically with the freed slaves are called  and were issued by General William Tecumseh Sherman, commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi of the United States Army, on January 16, 1865. They provided for the confiscation of 400,000 acres (1,600 km ) of land along the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida and the dividing of it into parcels of not more than 40 acres (0.16 km ), on which were to be settled approximately 18,000 freed slave families and other Blacks then living in the area. For the duration of the civil war, military officers had both special executive and legislative powers, and therefore, the Supreme Court judged that  General Sherman’s field orders have the same legal status as laws issued by the Congress, and have to be respected by the American government. NAACP national field director, Rev. Charles White, called the ruling a “historic step towards justice”. The decision of the Supreme court could have some major consequences, as it implies that the descendants of the 18,000 other free slave families covered by the 1865 field order. The NAACP, who supported M. Brown throughout all the court procedures, saluted the decision of the Supreme Court. The NAACP leader also called for a class action lawsuit, noting that more than 120,000 Americans are direct descendants of these slaves. How do I receive my great grandparents 40 acres and mule 18,000 and and mule do not expand to 120,000 Americans are direct descendants of these slaves. Those 120,000 would have to divide up what they were to get, it does expand exponentially. Grate , First Step Your email address will not be published.

Derby | Archaeologists excavating on the site of some recently discovered ruins on the northern coast of Western Australia may have just made the greatest find in the history of the country: the remains an 11th century Viking settlement.,"The scientists, associated with the Department of Archaeology of the University of Sydney, were called to the site after some locals discovered what looked like the foundation of an ancient building in July, near Derby. The archaeologists, directed by Professor Allison Fletcher, were expecting a site from the early colonial period, but they rapidly realized that they were dealing with something completely different. They have unearthed the foundations of three larger buildings which were identified as houses, and two smaller workshops identified as a carpentry, which was also used as a boat repair area, and a smithy, containing a forge and iron slag. The type of construction and the items found on the site are very similar to the various Viking colonies discovered in Greenland and Iceland. The scientists have also unearthed a total of sixteen tombs, including these warriors who were buried with their weapons and treasure. The archaeologists have discovered a large quantity and variety of artifacts on the site, including a few weapons and blacksmithing tools, some bronze and silver jewelry, four ivory combs, a few stone oil lamps, a dozen iron rivets and a bone knitting needle. While most of the items seem to be of Norse origin, a few of the items suggest that the inhabitants of the site were either conducting piracy in the region or they were part of an extended maritime trade network. Two broken pieces of porcelain, a bronze vessel and a jade ring from China were found in the tomb of one of the women, and some semi-precious stones from India and Sri Lanka were found in the tomb of one of the warriors. This proves that the Vikings had some form of contacts with the Asian continent, but the nature of these contacts remains uncertain. This large bronze vessel, found in the tomb if a Norse woman of high status, was manufactured in Southeastern China in the 9th or 10th Century. Professor Fletcher believes that the Norsemen could have chosen this site for its natural harbor, the availability of eucalyptus wood and the region’s abundant iron ore. It’s a long distance from the site of any known Viking settlement, expedition or raid, however, and it remains unclear how the Norsemen actually reached Australia. The Vikings were a seafaring people who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of northern and central Europe, as well as Russia, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries. Using their advanced seafaring skills and their famous longships, they are known to have created colonies and trading posts throughout the North Atlantic islands, navigating as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. The Vikings are also known to have raided North Africa and some Mediterranean islands, but this is the first time that any trace of their presence is found in the Indian Ocean. It is nice to know my ancestors were such powerful and capable people, especially since “raiding and trading” are the basis of our modern economy {see: “disaster capitalism”, destabilization} Your email address will not be published.

Yesterday afternoon, the couple set out to have sex in the Miami River while wearing some full-body dolphin costumes, planning to film themselves for their online fans. Unfortunately, things didn’t go quite as planned. According to Robert McCullers, who was fishing with his son and saw the couple head out in the water, the two suddenly disappeared in the river, as if they were being pulled under by an alligator. Mr. McCullers says he and several other fishermen headed out in the couple’s direction but were unable to locate them. Divers of the Miami Police Departments were looking for the couple’s remains in the Miami River. a few hours after the incident. Swimming while wearing a mascot costume is certainly not recommended, but several Americans keep taking risks and doing it, leading to an average of 37 death per year in the U.S. Although most of these deaths are caused by drowning, demises caused by shark and alligator attacks are not uncommon either. In 2017, a transspecies man swimming near Pensacola while wearing a latex shark costume was accidentally harpooned by agents of the U.S. Coast guard trying to protect swimmers at a nearby beach.

,"Mr. Erdoğan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque “in the crater” where they landed. Erdoğan said. The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya Çelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi’s famous rocket flights, but it’s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635. President Erdoğan’s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims. Erdoğan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II’s conquest of Istanbul in 1453. The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them. The description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesn’t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate. The story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the “aviator” could have survived a flight into outer space. His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode “Crash and Burn”.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya Çelebi’s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period; The team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been “extremely difficult” for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight He has also claimed that Turks discovered America first so they own it.

After seeing the results in a mirror, she suddenly became hysterical and tried to assault Mr. Moreno with a curling iron. Two customers of the establishment rapidly intervened to help the stylist. Fighting desperately, they were able to stop the woman and kick her out of the store. Ms. Gilmore was still determined to get her vengeance, however, and she waited more than four hours in a nearby parking lot for the victim to leave his workplace. When Mr. Moreno exited from the beauty salon around 2:15 PM, she charged him with her car and ran him over at more than 50 miles per hour. According to Roseanne Taylor, who works with Francesco Moreno and witnessed the attack, Ms. Gilmore drove back and forth over him at least 7 times. Several witnesses rapidly called the police, and the first officers arrived on the site less than two minutes later. They immediately arrested the 18-year old woman and called an ambulance on the site. Mr. Moreno was transported to the Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, where doctors were able to stabilize him. He suffers from severe internal bleeding, a perforated lung, two skull fractures, eight broken ribs and 21 other bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life. The Chicago Police Superintendent, Eddie Johnson, described the aggression as “one the most vicious” he has seen in his career. Cassandra Gilmore confessed to intentionally attacking Mr. Moreno, saying she wanted revenge after he “ruined her life” with his “botched haircut”. She allegedly explained that her prom night is only a month away and that she was under a lot of stress to make this “most important night of her life” perfect.

James Reynolds, one of the security guards who intercepted Ms. Smith says he was in disbelief when he understood where she had put it. The two security guards called the Greenville Police Department who rapidly proceeded to a cavity search and discovered the pumpkin. Mr. Reynolds says the officers dispatched on the site thought they were being pranked when they first explained the situation. The squash showed extremely difficult to extract and the 31-year-old woman had to be transported to the hospital, where it was finally removed after a delicate two-hour surgery.

Chow’s lawyer, Justin Wang, told reporters that he was currently not aware of any concrete evidence that his client, who has been charged with animal cruelty, had sold dog meat but that if he had, it was only a cultural misunderstanding, he argued.

An investigation led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has linked him to at least 42 acts of sabotage committed over the last two months on sugar shacks across Maine and 27 across Vermont. According to FBI spokesman Arthur Haroldson, the methodical destruction of the American maple syrup production capacity was ordered by the Canadian government to retaliate for American tariffs on steel and aluminum. Mr. Haroldson says investigators were able to identify the suspect after decrypting coded messages he allegedly hid in image files he shared on Instagram. The Canadian government has denied any link with the suspect, describing him as “a nationalist extremist known for his mental problems”. FBI spokesman Arthur Haroldson says investigators rapidly identified Canada as the primary suspect, allowing them to concentrate their efforts and act rapidly to end the sabotages. Andrew King now faces federal charges for espionage and acting as a foreign agent, as well as a total of 237 criminal charges. Due to the nature of the charges, his trial will be held behind closed doors and is set to begin next week. If found guilty, he could face the death penalty, but as is common in the world of espionage, he may also be exchanged for one or more of the four American spies actually detained in Canada.

"Rochester, NY | A redhead teenage boy has launched a controversial lawsuit against his parents this morning, for not preventing his birth, even if they were aware the high probability of his hair being red.","13-year old Liam Murphy, filed a “Wrongful Life” lawsuit against his red-haired parents, alleging that they knew their children would very likely inherit this undesirable trait. He claims that they caused him a “voluntary prejudice” by giving life to him, knowing that he would be born into a life of pain and suffering. He is demanding the incredible amount of $1.35 million in “pain and suffering”, that is, monetary compensation for the entire experience of having a disabled life versus having a healthy mind and body, as well as $800 000 in “loss of enjoyment of life”. Liam Murphy’s lawyer, James Franklin O’Connor, told reporters that his client’s claim is “incredibly conservative considering the situation”, and says he is confident about the upcoming trial. The boy’s lawyer told reporters that he personally thought his client could have demanded “at least three times” more than is actual demand, but that the teenager had decided to “go easy” on his parents. A 2014 study from the University College Cork did show that redheads are “more likely to be bullied” than others and concluded that “bullying of gingers” is “one of the last socially accepted forms of prejudice against people for a trait they were born with”. The results showed 60.6% of males and 47.3% of females with red hair said that they had suffered “some kind of discrimination in the past due to their hair color”. Even the British royal Prince Harry admitted to CBS in 2014, that he has been regularly bullied over his ginger locks in the past, and has sought councilling about it. Liam’s parents, however, have a very different perspective on the question, saying that “God gave him red hair”, not them, and that he should “be happy to be alive”. Liam’ parents, Larry and Theresa Murphy, say they don’t understand why the oldest of their three children is suing them. They say that for them, red hair is a “God-given particularity”, not a handicap. In recent years, a few “Wrongful Life” lawsuits have generated financial compensations of up to $20 millions for some children, but these were for plaintiffs born with heavy disabilities or debilitating diseases.

"Atmore, Alabama | When the prison staff asked 33-year Jeremy Morris if he wanted anything special for his last meal, he answered: “I just want a Bible”.","The prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible. Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it. It took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr. Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover. Walter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”. Holman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”. Director Davis says the guards were surprised to see Mr. Morris ingest the Bible, but did not feel the need to intervene. In most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request. Restrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal. Despite its unusual nature, Mr. Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities. Jeremy Morris is expected to be executed tomorrow for the killing of two Catholic nuns in 2007. That Bible probably tasted like crow after he died. Your email address will not be published.

"Embroiled in a scandal over his past wearing of blackface and brownface, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau now faces international criticism after new childhood pictures of his brother and him riding on the back of black children during a trip to Kenya.","The Canadian leader who’s actually running for reelection was embarrassed by two pictures and one video showing him wearing racist makeup during the first week of the election campaign. This new picture taken in 1981 by a Kenyan diplomat has stirred outrage around the world, bringing reactions from several Canadian politicians as well as foreign leaders. The leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer, said the recent series of revelations about Justin Trudeau’s past tend to show a “darker and creepier side hidden behind his good-guy image”. Even U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the pictures and the scandal during a press conference this morning. A photo of Justin Trudeau at West Point Grey Academy’s Arabian Nights gala in April 2001 was the first of a series of picture suggesting Trudeau in racially sensible positions revealed over only a few days. Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada since 2015 and he has built his political career around his image of a modern open-minded politician. This series of pictures and videos which seems to become longer and more shocking every day has already affected his party, which was largely favorite for the upcoming election. The latest polls suggest his Liberal Party of Canada could now finish second, as its image of the left-wing multiculturally-oriented party was hit hard by its leader’s racist past.

,"41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado. The powerful winds reaching more than 220 miles per hour, carried and shook the mobile home for 4 hours and 18 minutes, sometimes at altitude of more than 1000 feet. After carrying the house across Northern Colorado and Southern Kansas, the tornado finally dropped it on a car, just outside of Wichita, 129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin. A few locals have witnessed the landing, like Michael Johnson, a 63-year old neighboring farmer,  who describes an incredibly spectacular scene. The 60-feet long mobile home landed on an unoccupied car, in Butler county. The building has suffered surprisingly little structural damage considering the distance over which it was transported. Despite the violence of the crash, with the house landing at a speed of more than 90 miles per hour, the incident did not cause any death or serious injury. All five occupants of the house have miraculously survived their incredible misadventure, suffering only a few scratches and bruises. The family believes that their prayers were answered and that their survival is due to a divine intervention. An isolated set of concrete stairs remains on the family’s property in the Rolling Hills Mobile Home Park, in Tulsa, marking the site of the house’s former location. This is not the first time that a house is lifted off the ground by a tornado and carried over some distance with its occupant inside, without them being killed. It is, however, the longest distance ever recorded for such a case, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. On the evening of Thursday 12 June 2014, a house in Burnet County, Texas, about 16 km to the northeast of the city of Bertram, was lifted off its foundations by a tornado, The house was carried safely to a nearby pasture, with four members of the Ashworth family, plus their two dogs, unharmed.

"Cincinnati, OH | A 15-year old girl from Ohio claims to be carrying the child of Jesus Christ, after being “divinely impregnated” during an encounter with an angel.","Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she was visited by an “Angel of God” in July 2017, who told her that she had been chosen to bear the Christ’s son. “He told me that he was a Nephilim, like those described in the Bible,” explained the young girl. Nephilims are indeed mythical creatures mentioned in the Genesis 6:4: “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.” This type of creature has been almost unheard of over the last few thousand years, so the teenager’s claim has surprised everyone in her family when she announced it to them. Being very religious themselves, they rapidly accepted her claim and showed flawless support for the 15-year old. The medical doctor who has been following her pregnancy, Dr. William Franklin Murphy, says he is aware of his patient’s version but is unable to either confirm or invalidate her claims. “For all I know, her pregnancy seems normal,” claims the Due to laws concerning medical secrets, Dr. Murphy refused to discuss any details concerning the young woman’s pregnancy but said it didn’t really have anything really unusual except her apparent virginity. The teenager’s claim has stirred quite a controversy that has reached far beyond her religious community. While most people have shown their support to Ms. Smith-Nabengana, others have launched various accusations on the social media, ranging from fabricating the whole story to sleeping with a demonic creature known as an incubus. Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she wants to demand a paternity test as soon as her son is born, to prove that she is telling the truth.

A team of South African geneticists has developed what they call a “genetic correction serum” that could allow black parents to have white children.,"Scientists of the Stellenbosch University’s Department of Genetics have announced a major discovery concerning human genetics: a biochemical solution that allows altering hereditary traits of people of African descent to allow them to have Caucasian children. The geneticists working under the direction of Professor Hans Engelbrecht claim that their Genetic Correction Serum (GCS) has shown a 97.8% efficiency during lab tests, with only minor side effects like nausea, hair loss, and erectile problems. According to Professor Engelbrecht, the serum should be approved by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority soon and could be available to the public within a year from now to help solve the country’s racial problem. The renowned geneticist claims this “miracle serum” could be the first of a series of new treatments designed to modify the hereditary genes transmitted by parents to their children. Over 800 couples of African descent have participated in clinical studies which showed a success rate of nearly 98%. The announcement of the discovery has generated a lot of reactions across the country and around the world. While some enthusiastically welcomed the news as a definitive solution to the world’s inequities and racial problems, others were shocked and outraged, denouncing a “eugenic approach to genetics” as well as alleged “genocidal intentions” behind the development serum. Several South African civil rights organizations have announced their intentions to do everything in their power to change the country’s laws in order to make the serum illegal in the country and ban further research in the domain. Here is something that will surprise the great majority. A well-known lady, white in appearance(and, supposedly in ancestry) Has a black ancestress. I refer to Queen Elizabeth II.

"Juliet Manson, from Glendale in California, received a very special present from her mother for Christmas: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery.","The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years, insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother, Dana Manson,  says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time, but her daughter was “completely obsessed” with the idea of getting breast implants. Ms. Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter, hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result, however, was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with the young girl, the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem,  and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years, and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrist’s advice, Ms. Manson contacted dozens of clinics in the United States and Mexico, but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China, where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22, and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic, the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”. Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world, she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts. The young girl’s story caught the world’s attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery, instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media. Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age, while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation. Despite the critics, Dana Manson says she did “what was best for her daughter” and insists that she has no regrets. THAT TO ME IS CRAZY THE CHILD WILL GROW BREAST EVENTUALLY THE DR.

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe.","Mr. Hodges, who worked for the CIA for 41 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often employed as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the security of the country.  Trained as both a sniper and a martial arts expert, Mr. Hodges says he also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons and explosives. Mr. Hodges swears he remembers vividly, each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA.  He claims that all 37 of the murders he committed on the American soil, were ordered by his commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.

The 78-year old man was placed under custody by the FBI, which is taking Mr. Hodges’ confession very seriously and has opened an investigation to verify his allegations. The investigation might be very complicated, however, as very few written files are available on such secret activities and most of the actors implicated in the various cases are already dead.

"An Ohio couple’s attempts to spice up their sex life with some kinky roleplay turned horribly wrong last night, as they were both shot by hunters while having sex in the woods in Sasquatch costumes.","43-year old Chris Mumford and 41-year old Janet Smith were wearing disguises and engaging in loud sex in a wooded area a few miles out of Woodsfield when they were spotted by local hunters. Jarod Burns and his son were patrolling their property with rifles in hand, looking for signs of bears that may have awakened early from their hibernation, when he saw the hairy creatures. Mr. Burns and his son were convinced they were facing a couple of sasquatches, folkloric creatures said to be hairy, upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the North American wilderness. The two men fired eight shots, hitting Mr. Mumford three times in the shoulder, the leg, and the abdomen, and hitting Ms. Smith twice in the thigh and the forearm. Fortunately, the couple started screaming and swearing after getting shot, helping the hunters realize their mistake and call 911. Jarod Burns and his son fired eight shots in the couple’s direction, believing they were a couple of mating sasquatches. The adventurous couple was transported to Barnsville hospital where doctors were able to stabilize their condition and no longer fear for their lives. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office has opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances of the incident, and criminal charges could eventually be filed against the negligent hunters. Despite this unfortunate accident, Jarod Burns remains convinced that sasquatches exist and says he won’t hesitate to kill it if he sees a real one. What the hell did I just read

Krosno Odrzańskie| A pair of Polish fisherman made an amazing discovery when they opened the belly of the 410-pound catfish they had just caught in the Oder river.,"The stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones, as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World War. Alfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oder’s confluence with the Bóbr river on April 6, when they made an astonishing catch: a gigantic Wels catfish, measuring 12 feet (3.68 meters) and weighing 413 pounds (187.5 kg). Their celebration was rapidly transformed into interrogation, and then disgust, when they opened the animal’s belly. Among a large quantity of half-digested fish, they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany, as well dozens of human bone fragments. The two fishermen rapidly contacted the police, who opened an investigation to determine the origin of the remains. The insignia found in the fish’s belly, turned out to be a German SS hat eagle, dating back to Nazi Germany, that was usually worn on the front of the SS dress hat. The examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties, who died many decades ago. The biologists who examined the fish, for their part, confirmed that the enormous specimen was probably aged between 90 and 110 years old, making it one of the oldest catfish specimens ever found. Further analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s, and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer, killed during the occupation of Poland. The team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests, could not determine, however, if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animal. The stomach of the enormous catfish contained more than a dozen corroded bone fragments, mainly parts of a human neck and skull. The Wels catfish is a large fish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe. With a possible total length up to 4 m (13 ft) and a maximum weight of over 400 kg (880 lb), it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeon. Individuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons, ducks, rats, cats and even dogs, on land. Exceptionally large specimens have even been rumored to attack humans in rare instances, but this is the first time that human remains are actually found inside one of these fishes. A report in the Austrian newspaper   on 5 August 2009, mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, in Hungary, under water. The fish allegedly caught the man by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold. The man barely escaped with his life, from a fish which must have weighed over 100 kg (220 lb), according to the fisherman. GTFOH…💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 Your email address will not be published.

"A man who was born with three testicles had a very unpleasant surprise after getting his extra testicle removed last week: he learned that the presumed gland was, in fact, his dead and undeveloped conjoined twin.","51-year old James Wong, from Eugene in Oregon, underwent an orchiectomy last Thursday, a surgery meant to remove his third testicle, which represented a risk of producing excess testosterone and causing health issues. Less than a week later, he received a call from the hospital telling him that the biopsy had revealed that his testicle wasn’t what it seemed. Mr. Wong says he was surprised by the news, but that he was somehow aware of his brother’s presence. The surgeon who performed the operation, Dr. Jerome Mackensie, says he never suspected these results before he received the lab results a week after the surgery. This isn’t the first time that people live several years as individuals before learning they were conjoined twins. Four other cases have been recorded in the U.S. alone over the last twenty years and over 20 others across the globe, but all other cases involve people living less than 7 years without knowledge of their condition. Mr. Wong’s case, therefore, stands out due to the age at which he learned about the existence of his twin. The unusual shape and location of his twin brother have also contributed to drawing a lot of attention and mockery on social media, making his story more public than most similar cases.

"Rolla, MO | FBI agents cracked down on unsuspecting party goers at a Missouri pig farm yesterday where more than 40 arrests were made over allegations of bestiality and animal cruelty.","Suspected for some time by local authorities of running a pig farm functioning as an underground pig brothel, where clients paid for sexual services with the farm animals, the 67-year old farm owner was arrested with two of his sons and some 30 guests who were present to celebrate his birthday. Caught in full action during the night of the birthday bash, the FBI raid engaged more than 16 agents in what local officials believe to be the biggest crackdown on an animal brothel in American history. Hundreds of piglets were forced into sexual acts with clients of the pig brothel Local authorities fear a recrudescence in sexually deviant behavior with animals in the region since this is the third animal brothel to be closed down in recent months in the area. – Dane Banff, psychologist “That human beings are allowed to unleash their wildest fantasies in such a context, even though illegal, might prevent such abuses as rape from being committed” she admits. “But at the same time, having sexual relations with pigs and other animals is not considered to be a healthy behavior and should not be encouraged” she acknowledges. The farmer and his sons could spend up to five years in prison expect legal experts. Oinkin’ genius! All these years I’ve been selling myself… 
And I’m I am sow sure that no pig ever complained about being sold for sex rather than slaughter! Your email address will not be published.

"Suez | Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.","The team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age. The scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor. They estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site. This magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a richly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman. Many clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus. First of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area. The sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted. This new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten. For centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical. “It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base. A lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered. To Donald Hardy, to simplify the Trinity think of the body, word and Breath. That is “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning” John chapter 1:1,2. From Florence Your email address will not be published.
